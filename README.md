##  **Getting Set Up**
#### Ensure Python 3.5+ is downloaded
 The [Stacks Documentation](https://subinitial.com/misc/doc/index.html) states that the Python 3 version must be version 3.6+, but previous versions have worked

Run in terminal
``` python --version ```

* If Python is not downloaded, install using apt
```
sudo apt install python3
```


* Or download from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Additional packages needed for install

   - Linux (Debian/Ubuntu),  ``` sudo apt install git ```
   - Windows, Download from [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
