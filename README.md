1.  **Getting Set Up**
    1.  Ensure Python 3.5+ is downloaded
        *   The [Stacks Documentation](https://subinitial.com/misc/doc/index.html) states that the Python 3 version must be version 3.6+, but previous versions have worked
        *   Run in terminal

            ```bash :$ python --version
Python 3.5.3
```


        *   If Python is not downloaded, install using apt along with pip

            ```
:$ sudo apt install python3
```


        *   Or download from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    1.  Additional packages needed for install
        *   Git
            *   Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

                ```
:$ sudo apt install git
```


            *   Windows

                Download from [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

        *   Ensure the Stacks python library is installed
            *   Inside a python shell

                ```
>>> import subinitial.stacks as stacks
>>> print("Stacks Version:", stacks.VERSION_STACKS[0])
Stacks Version: 1
```


            *   If not installed, install using pip3

                ```bash 
:$ pip3 install --user git+https://bitbucket.org/subinitial/subinitial.git
